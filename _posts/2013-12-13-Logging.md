## Logging - Take advantage of MDC(Mapped Diagnostic Context)

With a multi-threaded application, you have each thread working on different parts. Making sense of the logs generated can be tricky, since the messages from different threads will get interspersed.

An ugly way to solve this is by appending every log statement with an identifier identifying the unique part of work being executed.
Example:
log.debug("getting billing address for customer id {}", customerid); 
log.debug("getting order information for customer id {}", customerid);
log.debug("getting shipping address for customer id {}", customerid);

But a very easy and elegant approach to this problem is to use MDC. At the start of your thread, set up your MDC.
Example:
```
MDC.put("customerid", customerid);
log.debug("getting billing address"); 
log.debug("getting order information");
log.debug("getting shipping address");
```
In logback.xml, configure pattern layout as shown below.
```
<Pattern>%X{customerid} - %m%n</Pattern>
``` 
Then automatically the log messages will include the customerid information. Now when viewing the logs, it will be easy to distinguish log messages from different threads.
