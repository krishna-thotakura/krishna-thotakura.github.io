## Caching
You can perform caching at the database entity level via Hibernate Caching and/or method level via Spring Caching. Both approaches can use ehcache for the cache implementation.

Hibernate Caching
Query Cache depends on 2nd level cache. Let us say you annotated your queries using org.hibernate.cacheable. Now, if a cached query is submitted with same parameters as earlier, the cached query results are used(if query is still in cache and not expired). But in order to use the cached query results, the entities(not live, in dehydrated state) need to be present in the 2nd level cache. If they are not, they would be fetched from the database for each id not present in the 2nd level cache. Hence, You might end up hitting the database lot more often than without any caching present.

Spring Caching
Provides Method level caching using Cacheable and CacheEvict.
Caching can be easily turned off to run the application with caching and without caching and run some comparison, and see where caching is helping and where it is hurting, and find where the gaps are.
```
<prop key="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">false</prop>
<prop key="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache">false</prop>
```
Also note that spring-context and spring-context-support provides hibernate-ehcache support. Hence, you can avoid conflicts by not pulling in hibernate-ehcache separately.
